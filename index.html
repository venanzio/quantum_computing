<strong>
MGS 2020 has been cancelled due to Covid-19.<br>
It was going place at the University of Sheffield in the period 20-24 April.<br>
This page contains the material from the 2017 course.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Although computers have a finite memory and cannot store an infinite amount of
information, Functional Programming and Type Theory allow us to represent 
infinite mathematical objects.
These are represented as processes that generate part of the structure at every 
step. The mathematical/categorical formulation for these processes is the
notion of coalgebra. 
</p><p>
The first part of the course is an introduction to coalgebras with important 
examples like streams (infinite sequences) and non-well-founded trees. 
The most powerful proof method for infinite data structures is the Coinduction 
Principle, which allows us to prove the equality of two objects by a 
bisimulation, itself an infinite process that generates the equality by 
successive stages. 
</p><p>
We will study methods to construct sound infinite objects, to solve recursive 
equations on them and to prove their properties. Examples will be given using 
functional programming in Haskell and formal reasoning in Coq. 
In Type Theory we can define coinductively not just single types, but families 
of types, predicates and relations. This leads to a proof technique in which 
the statement to be proved can be used recursively as long as it satisfies 
a guardedness conditions. It amounts to constructing a proof with an infinite 
number of logical steps. 
</p><p>
We can combine coinduction with induction in several ways to define types with 
a complex internal structure. One example is the definition of all continuous 
functions between streams. A further generalization consists in defining 
a coinductive type simultaneously with a recursive function on it, in the style 
of induction-recursion. This leads to a very general notion of Wander types, 
that can be instantiated to many of the most common type-theoretic 
constructions.
